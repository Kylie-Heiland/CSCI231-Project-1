/* Output:

 * Answer to 1.6: When I change System to system, I get an error saying, "package system does not exist." This is a syntax error because Java is case-sensitive. And while "System" is not a 
 * package by itself, it is considered to be in a package with "out" and "println." Thus, when "System" is misspelled, it causes the entire package not to exist and therefore produces the 
 * error and keeps it from compiling. 
 * 
 * Answer to 1.7: When breaking the line of code and indenting " World!"); ," multiple syntax errors occur pointing out twice that there are unclosed string literals, as well as saying 
 * " World!"); " is not a statement and is also missing a semicolon. 
 * 
 * Answer to 1.8: When changing the first println to print while the line of code is still broken, all errors remain the same. However, when putting the code back to what it originally
 * was and adjusting println to print, it compiles successfully, although the output is now:
 * 
 * "Hello, World!This is my first Java Program"
 * 
 * Since println adds a new line after the initial statement, and print does not.
